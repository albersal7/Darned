# Darned
A videogame i've made using Unity Engine.
The game was made in a period of 1 month and all the assets and code was made by me. Both the artistic and Technical part was made by me.
The scripts made are for the character movement, abilities and world interaction. Other scripts belong to the enemies, for example the AI and the behaviour.
